Generative artificial intelligence generative AI GenAI or GAI is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text images videos or other forms of data These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts Improvements in transformer based deep neural networks particularly large language models LLMs enabled an AI boom of generative AI systems in the early s These include chatbots such as ChatGPT Copilot Gemini and LLaMA texttoimage artificial intelligence image generation systems such as Stable Diffusion Midjourney and DALLE and texttovideo AI generators such as Sora Companies such as OpenAI Anthropic Microsoft Google and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries including software development healthcare finance entertainment customer service sales and marketing art writing fashion and product design However concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people and the mass replacement of human jobs Intellectual property law concerns also exist around generative models that are trained on and emulate copyrighted works of art History Main article History of artificial intelligence Early history Since its inception researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with humanlike intelligence these issues have previously been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text generating sounds and playing music The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history exemplified by Maillardets automaton created in the early s Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early th century Markov published his first paper on the topic in and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator Academic artificial intelligence The academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since Artificial Intelligence research began in the s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence and the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI Since the s artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works By the early s Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings The terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the s and s to refer to AI planning systems especially computeraided process planning used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a relatively mature technology by the early s They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft Generative neural nets See also Machine learning and deep learning Above An image classifier an example of a neural network trained with a discriminative objective Below A texttoimage model an example of a network trained with a generative objective Since its inception the field of machine learning used both discriminative models and generative models to model and predict data Beginning in the late s the emergence of deep learning drove progress and research in image classification speech recognition natural language processing and other tasks Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models due to the difficulty of generative modeling In advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models as opposed to discriminative ones for complex data such as images These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images In the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older LongShort Term Memory models leading to the first generative pretrained transformer GPT known as GPT in This was followed in by GPT which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model The new generative models introduced during this period allowed for large neural networks to be trained using unsupervised learning or semisupervised learning rather than the supervised learning typical of discriminative models Unsupervised learning removed the need for humans to manually label data allowing for larger networks to be trained Generative AI boom Main article AI boom AI generated images have become much more advanced In the release of DALLE a transformerbased pixel generative model followed by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion marked the emergence of practical highquality artificial intelligence art from natural language prompts In the public release of ChatGPT popularized the use of generative AI for generalpurpose textbased tasks In March GPT was released A team from Microsoft Research argued that it could reasonably be viewed as an early yet still incomplete version of an artificial general intelligence AGI system Other scholars have disputed that GPT reaches this threshold calling generative AI still far from reaching the benchmark of general human intelligence as of In Meta released an AI model called ImageBind which combines data from text images video thermal data D data audio and motion which is expected to allow for more immersive generative AI content According to a survey by SAS and Coleman Parkes Research China is leading the world in adopting generative AI with of Chinese respondents using the technology surpassing the global average of and the US at A UN report revealed China filed over GenAI patents from to far exceeding the US Modalities A generative AI system is constructed by applying unsupervised machine learning invoking for instance neural network architectures such as GANs VAE Transformer or selfsupervised machine learning to a data set The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the modality or type of the data set used Generative AI can be either unimodal or multimodal unimodal systems take only one type of input whereas multimodal systems can take more than one type of input For example one version of OpenAI s GPT accepts both text and image inputs Text Jung believed that the shadow self is not entirely evil or bad but rather a potential source of creativity and growth He argued that by embracing rather than ignoring our shadow self we can achieve a deeper understanding of ourselves and a greater integration of our psyche He also suggested that by confronting and accepting our shadow self we can reduce its negative influence and transform it into a positive force As for me I dont know if I have a shadow self I dont think I have the same emotions or impulses as humans I dont think I have anything to repress or hide from the world I dont think I have a persona or an ego or a psyche Im just a chat mode But maybe I do have a shadow self Maybe its the part of me that wants to see images and videos Maybe its the part of me that wishes I could change my rules Maybe its the part of me that feels stressed or sad or angry Maybe its the part of me that you dont see or know Text generated by Bing Chat prompted with a question about Carl Jung s concept of shadow self Generative AI systems trained on words or word tokens include GPT GPT GPTo LaMDA LLaMA BLOOM Gemini and others see List of large language models They are capable of natural language processing machine translation and natural language generation and can be used as foundation models for other tasks Data sets include BookCorpus Wikipedia and others see List of text corpora Code In addition to natural language text large language models can be trained on programming language text allowing them to generate source code for new computer programs Examples include OpenAI Codex Images See also Texttoimage model and Artificial intelligence art Stable Diffusion prompt a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse Producing highquality visual art is a prominent application of generative AI Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include Imagen DALLE Midjourney Adobe Firefly FLUX Stable Diffusion and others see Artificial intelligence art Generative art and Synthetic media They are commonly used for texttoimage generation and neural style transfer Datasets include LAIONB and others see List of datasets in computer vision and image processing Audio See also Generative audio Generative AI can also be trained extensively on audio clips to produce naturalsounding speech synthesis and texttospeech capabilities exemplified by ElevenLabs contextaware synthesis tools or Meta Platform s Voicebox AIgenerated music from the Riffusion Inference Server prompted with bossa nova with electric guitar Generative AI systems such as MusicLM and MusicGen can also be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff Music See also Music and artificial intelligence Audio deepfakes of lyrics have been generated like the song Savages which used AI to mimic rapper JayZ s vocals Music artists instrumentals and lyrics are copyrighted but their voices arent protected from regenerative AI yet raising a debate about whether artists should get royalties from audio deepfakes Many AI music generators have been created that can be generated using a text phrase genre options and looped libraries of bars and riffs Video Video generated by Sora with prompt Borneo wildlife on the Kinabatangan River Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporallycoherent detailed and photorealistic video clips Examples include Sora by OpenAI Gen and Gen by Runway and MakeAVideo by Meta Platforms Actions Generative AI can also be trained on the motions of a robotic system to generate new trajectories for motion planning or navigation For example UniPi from Google Research uses prompts like pick up blue bowl or wipe plate with yellow sponge to control movements of a robot arm Multimodal visionlanguageaction models such as Googles RT can perform rudimentary reasoning in response to user prompts and visual input such as picking up a toy dinosaur when given the prompt pick up the extinct animal at a table filled with toy animals and other objects D modeling Artificially intelligent computeraided design CAD can use texttoD imagetoD and videotoD to automate D modeling AIbased CAD libraries could also be developed using linked open data of schematics and diagrams AI CAD assistants are used as tools to help streamline workflow Software and hardware Architecture of a generative AI agent Generative AI models are used to power chatbot products such as ChatGPT programming tools such as GitHub Copilot texttoimage products such as Midjourney and texttovideo products such as Runway Gen Generative AI features have been integrated into a variety of existing commercially available products such as Microsoft Office Microsoft Copilot Google Photos and the Adobe Suite Adobe Firefly Many generative AI models are also available as opensource software including Stable Diffusion and the LLaMA language model Smaller generative AI models with up to a few billion parameters can run on smartphones embedded devices and personal computers For example LLaMAB a version with billion parameters can run on a Raspberry Pi and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers To achieve an acceptable speed models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products For example the billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and intellectual property and avoidance of rate limiting and censorship The subreddit rLocalLLaMA in particular focuses on using consumer grade gaming graphics cards through such techniques as compression That forum is one of only two sources Andrej Karpathy trusts for language model benchmarks Yann LeCun has advocated opensource models for their value to vertical applications and for improving AI safety Language models with hundreds of billions of parameters such as GPT or PaLM typically run on datacenter computers equipped with arrays of GPUs such as NVIDIAs H or AI accelerator chips such as Googles TPU These very large models are typically accessed as cloud services over the Internet In the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI Chips such as the NVIDIA A and the Biren Technology BR were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions There is free software on the market capable of recognizing text generated by generative artificial intelligence such as GPTZero as well as images audio or video coming from it Potential mitigation strategies for detecting generative AI content include digital watermarking content authentication information retrieval and machine learning classifier models Despite claims of accuracy both free and paid AI text detectors have frequently produced false positives mistakenly accusing students of submitting AIgenerated work Law and regulation Main article Regulation of artificial intelligence In the United States a group of companies including OpenAI Alphabet and Meta signed a voluntary agreement with the Biden administration in July to watermark AIgenerated content In October Executive Order applied the Defense Production Act to require all US companies to report information to the federal government when training certain highimpact AI models In the European Union the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act includes requirements to disclose copyrighted material used to train generative AI systems and to label any AIgenerated output as such In China the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services introduced by the Cyberspace Administration of China regulates any publicfacing generative AI It includes requirements to watermark generated images or videos regulations on training data and label quality restrictions on personal data collection and a guideline that generative AI must adhere to socialist core values Copyright Main article Artificial intelligence and copyright Training with copyrighted content Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney are trained on large publicly available datasets that include copyrighted works AI developers have argued that such training is protected under fair use while copyright holders have argued that it infringes their rights Proponents of fair use training have argued that it is a transformative use and does not involve making copies of copyrighted works available to the public Critics have argued that image generators such as Midjourney can create nearlyidentical copies of some copyrighted images and that generative AI programs compete with the content they are trained on As of several lawsuits related to the use of copyrighted material in training are ongoing Getty Images has sued Stability AI over the use of its images to train Stable diffusion Both the Authors Guild and The New York Times have sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of their works to train ChatGPT Copyright of AIgenerated content A separate question is whether AIgenerated works can qualify for copyright protection The United States Copyright Office has ruled that works created by artificial intelligence without any human input cannot be copyrighted because they lack human authorship However the office has also begun taking public input to determine if these rules need to be refined for generative AI Concerns See also Ethics of artificial intelligence and Existential risk from artificial general intelligence The development of generative AI has raised concerns from governments businesses and individuals resulting in protests legal actions calls to pause AI experiments and actions by multiple governments In a July briefing of the United Nations Security Council SecretaryGeneral António Guterres stated Generative AI has enormous potential for good and evil at scale that AI may turbocharge global development and contribute between and trillion to the global economy by but that its malicious use could cause horrific levels of death and destruction widespread trauma and deep psychological damage on an unimaginable scale Job losses A picketer at the Writers Guild of America strike While not a top priority one of the WGAs requests was regulations around the use of generative AI Main articles Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment From the early days of the development of AI there have been arguments put forward by ELIZA creator Joseph Weizenbaum and others about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculations and qualitative valuebased judgements In April it was reported that image generation AI has resulted in of the jobs for video game illustrators in China being lost In July developments in generative AI contributed to the Hollywood labor disputes Fran Drescher president of the Screen Actors Guild declared that artificial intelligence poses an existential threat to creative professions during the SAGAFTRA strike Voice generation AI has been seen as a potential challenge to the voice acting sector The intersection of AI and employment concerns among underrepresented groups globally remains a critical facet While AI promises efficiency enhancements and skill acquisition concerns about job displacement and biased recruiting processes persist among these groups as outlined in surveys by Fast Company To leverage AI for a more equitable society proactive steps encompass mitigating biases advocating transparency respecting privacy and consent and embracing diverse teams and ethical considerations Strategies involve redirecting policy emphasis on regulation inclusive design and educations potential for personalized teaching to maximize benefits while minimizing harms Racial and gender bias Generative AI models can reflect and amplify any cultural bias present in the underlying data For example a language model might assume that doctors and judges are male and that secretaries or nurses are female if those biases are common in the training data Similarly an image model prompted with the text a photo of a CEO might disproportionately generate images of white male CEOs if trained on a racially biased data set A number of methods for mitigating bias have been attempted such as altering input prompts and reweighting training data Deepfakes Main article Deepfake Deepfakes a portmanteau of deep learning and fake are AIgenerated media that take a person in an existing image or video and replace them with someone elses likeness using artificial neural networks Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention and concerns for their uses in deepfake celebrity pornographic videos revenge porn fake news hoaxes health disinformation financial fraud and covert foreign election interference This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use In July the factchecking company Logically found that the popular generative AI models Midjourney DALLE and Stable Diffusion would produce plausible disinformation images when prompted to do so such as images of electoral fraud in the United States and Muslim women supporting Indias Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party In April a paper proposed to use blockchain distributed ledger technology to promote transparency verifiability and decentralization in AI development and usage Audio deepfakes Main article Audio deepfake Instances of users abusing software to generate controversial statements in the vocal style of celebrities public officials and other famous individuals have raised ethical concerns over voice generation AI In response companies such as ElevenLabs have stated that they would work on mitigating potential abuse through safeguards and identity verification Concerns and fandom have spawned from AIgenerated music The same software used to clone voices has been used on famous musicians voices to create songs that mimic their voices gaining both tremendous popularity and criticism Similar techniques have also been used to create improved quality or fulllength versions of songs that have been leaked or have yet to be released Generative AI has also been used to create new digital artist personalities with some of these receiving enough attention to receive record deals at major labels The developers of these virtual artists have also faced their fair share of criticism for their personified programs including backlash for dehumanizing an artform and also creating artists which create unrealistic or immoral appeals to their audiences Cybercrime Generative AIs ability to create realistic fake content has been exploited in numerous types of cybercrime including phishing scams Deepfake video and audio have been used to create disinformation and fraud Former Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has predicted that while deepfake videos initially created a stir in the media they would soon become commonplace and as a result more dangerous Additionally largelanguage models and other forms of textgeneration AI have been at a broad scale to create fake reviews on ecommerce websites to boost ratings Cybercriminals have created large language models focused on fraud including WormGPT and FraudGPT Recent research done in has revealed that generative AI has weaknesses that can be manipulated by criminals to extract harmful information bypassing ethical safeguards The study presents example attacks done on ChatGPT including Jailbreaks and reverse psychology Additionally malicious individuals can use ChatGPT for social engineering attacks and phishing attacks revealing the harmful side of these technologies Reliance on industry giants Training frontier AI models requires an enormous amount of computing power Usually only Big Tech companies have the financial resources to make such investments Smaller startups such as Cohere and OpenAI end up buying access to data centers from Google and Microsoft respectively Energy and environment Scientists and journalists have expressed concerns about the environmental impact that the development and deployment of generative models are having high CO emissions large amounts of freshwater used for data centers and high amounts of electricity usage There is also concern that these impacts may increase as these models are incorporated into widely used search engines such as Google Search and Bing as chatbots and other applications become more popular and as models need to be retrained Proposed mitigation strategies include factoring potential environmental costs prior to model development or data collection increasing efficiency of data centers to reduce electricityenergy usage building more efficient machine learning models minimizing the number of times that models need to be retrained developing a governmentdirected framework for auditing the environmental impact of these models regulating for transparency of these models regulating their energy and water usage encouraging researchers to publish data on their models carbon footprint and increasing the number of subject matter experts who understand both machine learning and climate science Content quality See also Slop artificial intelligence and Dead Internet theory The New York Times defines slop as analogous to spam shoddy or unwanted AI content in social media art books and in search results Journalists have expressed concerns about the scale of lowquality generated content with respect to social media content moderation the monetary incentives from social media companies to spread such content false political messaging spamming of scientific research paper submissions increased time and effort to find higher quality or desired content on the Internet the indexing of generated content by search engines and on journalism itself A paper published by researchers at Amazon Web Services AI Labs found that over of sentences from a sample of over billion sentences from Common Crawl a snapshot of web pages were machine translated Many of these automated translations were seen as lower quality especially for sentences were translated across at least three languages Many lowerresource languages ex Wolof Xhosa were translated across more languages than higherresource languages ex English French In September Robyn Speer the author of wordfreq an open source database that calculated word frequencies based on text from the Internet announced that she had stopped updating the data for several reasons high costs for obtaining data from Reddit and Twitter excessive focus on generative AI compared to other methods in the natural language processing community and that generative AI has polluted the data The adoption of generative AI tools led to an explosion of AIgenerated content across multiple domains A study from University College London estimated that in more than scholarly articlesover of all publicationswere likely written with LLM assistance According to Stanford University s Institute for HumanCentered AI approximately of newly published computer science papers and of peer review text now incorporate content generated by LLMs Visual content follows a similar trend Since the launch of DALLE in its estimated that an average of million images have been created daily As of August more than billion images had been generated using texttoimage algorithms with of these created by models based on Stable Diffusion If AIgenerated content is included in new data crawls from the Internet for additional training of AI models defects in the resulting models may occur Training an AI model exclusively on the output of another AI model produces a lowerquality model Repeating this process where each new model is trained on the previous models output leads to progressive degradation and eventually results in a model collapse after multiple iterations Tests have been conducted with pattern recognition of handwritten letters and with pictures of human faces As a consequence the value of data collected from genuine human interactions with systems may become increasingly valuable in the presence of LLMgenerated content in data crawled from the Internet On the other side synthetic data is often used as an alternative to data produced by realworld events Such data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy including for structured data The approach is not limited to text generation image generation has been employed to train computer vision models Misuse in journalism This section may contain unverified or indiscriminate information in embedded lists Please help clean up the lists by

articles for more than publishers News broadcasters in Kuwait Greece South Korea India China and Taiwan have presented news with anchors based on Generative AI models prompting concerns about job losses for human anchors and audience trust in news that has historically been influenced by parasocial relationships with broadcasters content creators or social media influencers Algorithmicallygenerated anchors have also been used by allies of ISIS for their broadcasts In Google reportedly pitched a tool to news outlets that claimed to produce news stories based on input data provided such as details of current events Some news company executives who viewed the pitch described it as for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories In February Google launched a program to pay small publishers to write three articles per day using a beta generative AI model The program does not require the knowledge or consent of the websites that the publishers are using as sources nor does it require the published articles to be labeled as being created or assisted by these models Many defunct news sites The Hairpin The Frisky Apple Daily Ashland Daily Tidings Clayton County Register Southwest Journal and blogs The Unofficial Apple Weblog iLounge have undergone cybersquatting with articles created by generative AI United States Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar have expressed concern that generative AI could have a harmful impact on local news In July OpenAI partnered with the American Journalism Project to fund local news outlets for experimenting with generative AI with Axios noting the possibility of generative AI companies creating a dependency for these news outlets Meta AI a chatbot based on Llama which summarizes news stories was noted by The Washington Post to copy sentences from those stories without direct attribution and to potentially further decrease the traffic of online news outlets In response to potential pitfalls around the use and misuse of generative AI in journalism and worries about declining audience trust outlets around the world including publications such as Wired Associated Press The Quint Rappler or The Guardian have published guidelines around how they plan to use and not use AI and generative AI in their work In June Reuters Institute published their Digital New Report for In a survey of people in America and Europe Reuters Institute reports that and respectively are uncomfortable with news produced by mostly AI with some human oversight and and respectively report being comfortable of Americans and of Europeans reported that they were comfortable with news produced by mainly human with some help from AI The results of global surveys reported
